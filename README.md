#tuning-morpher

A real-time frequnency ratio modifier for the Java Music Specification Language (JMSL).

When using JMSL for synthesis and music creation, synthesis units use a table of frequency ratios that corresponds with the intervals in a scale. Tuning-morpher allows the realtime modification of these tuning tables either directly or through a GUI. This extends the creative possiblities of JMSL and opens up tuning as a creative/compositional tool.
